# Project: Investigating why patients don't show up at the appointments?
## by Shweta Negi


## Dataset

> A person makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and no-show. Who to blame? So here I am going to analyze the dataset regarding medical appointments in Brazil. The dataset is taken from Kaggle, contains information of more than 100,000 medical appointments, details about the patients, and whether they showed up for their appointments or not.

## Important points to Focus while Investigation

> 1. What is the gender distribution in patients?
2. What is the age distribution in patients?
3. Which age groups are more likely to not show up at the appointment?
4. Which specific condition or combination of specific conditions are related to no show up?
5. What is the relationship between no show up and the scholarship received?
6. How is not showing up of the patients is related to their sms receiving?

## Key Insights from Investigation

> 1. There are around 65% of male patients and around 35% female patients.
2. Most of the patients are below 75 years of age, only around 5% patients are older than that. Patients below the age of 50 are more likely to not show up at the appointment.
3. Only a very few of the patients show alcoholism or are handicapped and around 1/10th of patients are suffering from diabetes and slightly greater than 1/5th of patients are suffering from hypertension. Among them around 1/5th of the people who do not have any specific condition like hypertension, diabetes alcoholism or handicapped associated to them are not showing up.
4. Only around 10% patients receive scholarship and this Scholarship that is provided in Bolsa Fam√≠lia welfare program is not affecting the showing or not showing up of the patients to a very great extent.
5. Only less than 40% patients receive sms regarding the appointment and even after receiving sms patients are not showing up at the apppointment.
